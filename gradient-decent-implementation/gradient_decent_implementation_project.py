# the linear region near 0 and not squashed at the high and low ends. It's also important to initialize them randomly
# so that they all have different starting values and diverge, breaking symmetry. So, we'll initialize the weights
# from a normal distribution centered at 0. A good value for the scale is 1/sqrt{n}â€‹ where n is the number
# of input units. This keeps the input to the sigmoid low for increasing numbers of input units.

# element in array 2, and so on. Then, each product is summed.

# input to the output layer
# output = np.dot(weights, inputs) which is the same as output = x[0] * weights[0] + x[1] * weights[1] ...
